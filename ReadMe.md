# Event Camle

### helper library for allowing us to deal with events on the browser our any javascript enviroment
### it is fast as the camel in the race.

## Features:
* Easy To use.
* very portable.you can take it and use it in big projects.
* very small.you can go and check how it works.
* checking For Events strings(length less than 1 and spaces are not allowed ).
* clear errors when they Occures.
* dealing with single-events instances
* browser friendly.

## Installation

### clone this repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Moonpoll2004/event_camel
```

## Basic Usage

### You can listen for any events and emit them like in nodejs 

```javascript
//require event_camel
const event_camel = require("event_camel")

//my camel object
const camel = new event_camel()

//Adding events and their handlers
camel.On("my-event",function(name) {
    console.log(name)
})

camel.On("calc",function(number,num2) {
    console.log(Math.pow(number,num2))
})

//over write an exsiting event
camel.On("my-event",function(name) {
    console.log("Hi we over write priviose event ",name)
})


//Emiting Events
camel.Emit("my-event","khattab")
camel.Emit("calc",12,2)


//error: "undefined event"
camel.Emit("some undefiend event",12)

```

## listing for Dom Events

### You can play with dom events and change them with your handlers
### make sure that you are using the client side version on dist/event_camel.js

        const camel = new EventCamel()
        var counter = document.getElementById("counter")

        //get Increment and decremnt buttons
        var inc_btn = document.getElementById("inc-btn")
        var dec_btn = document.getElementById("dec-btn")


        //setting main events "decremnt" and "increment"
        camel.On("increment",function(payload){
            counter.innerText = parseInt(counter.innerText) + payload  
        })

        camel.On("decrement",function(payload){
            counter.innerText = parseInt(counter.innerText) - payload
        })


        //buttons listeners
        inc_btn.addEventListener("click",function(){
            camel.Emit("increment",1)
        })

        dec_btn.addEventListener("click",function(){
            camel.Emit("decrement",1)
        })
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

### It looks like the double work but in fact It can very help full at orgnize your code accross many javascript files
### for the full styled example check dist folder.

## Emit API
### rich API that allows you to emit events easly in diffirent situtaions
```javascript

const camel = new event_camel()

camel.On("more-than-100",function (event) {
    console.log("helle from event "+event)
})

camel.On("less-than-100",function(event){
    console.log("helle from event "+event)
})

camel.On("green",function(event){
    console.log("helle from event "+event)
})

camel.On("red",function(event){
    console.log("helle from event "+event)
})

camel.On("yellow",function(event){
    console.log("helle from event "+event)
})

//Emit single Event
camel.Emit("yellow")

//Emit Many Events
camel.EmitMany(["yellow","red","green"])

//Emit All Events
camel.EmitAll()

//Emit when the condition is equal to result
const num = 99
const condition = num < 100
const if_true = true
const if_false = false

camel.EmitIf("less-than-100",condition,if_true)
camel.EmitIf("more-than-100",condition,if_false)
```

## Single-Events

### Single Events are basicly one Event Generated by CamelEvent function
### It is recomended to use EventCamel instance in large applications but you have the Choice
```javascript
const MyEvent = CamelEvent("event1",function(event){
    console.log("hello from single event")
},{trace:true,trace_func:function(event){console.log("traking.."+event)}})

//trace function is going to run befor
MyEvent.Emit()
```
### You might ask your self why I need to define event_name again? The answer is that in most times you are going to deal whith many events at the time.
### There is a function called CamelEventsTree to help you deal with many single events
```javascript
const order_car = CamelEvent("order-car",function(event){
    console.log("This is single event for ordering " + event)
})

const order_pizza = CamelEvent("order-pizza",function(event){
    console.log("this is single event for ordering " + event)
})

const order_halwa = CamelEvent("order-halwa",function(event){
    console.log("this is single event for ordering" + event)
})


const events_tree = CamelEventsTree([order_car,order_pizza])
//You Can Add The one by one if yu like

events_tree.addEvent(order_halwa)

events_tree.EmitOne("order-halwa")
events_tree.EmitOne("order-pizza")
```

### The reason Why it is not recomended because events_tree.EmitOne() Find the frist match based one event name
### so maybe if you duplicate events_names it going to case problmes in production
### just use  EventCamel instance and you are Fine with unique events handling
